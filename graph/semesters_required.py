"""
semesters required

Write a function, semesters_required, that takes in a number of 
courses (n) and a list of prerequisites as arguments. Courses 
have ids ranging from 0 through n - 1. A single prerequisite of 
(A, B) means that course A must be taken before course B. Return 
the minimum number of semesters required to complete all n 
courses. There is no limit on how many courses you can take in 
a single semester, as long the prerequisites of a course are 
satisfied before taking it.

Note that given prerequisite (A, B), you cannot take course A 
and course B concurrently in the same semester. You must take 
A in some semester before B.

You can assume that it is possible to eventually complete 
all courses.
